## To Do
- Implement proper Supabase RLS policies after core functionality is stable
- Add proper Row-Level Security to group_members and groups tables
- Consider implementing request debouncing for API calls to prevent excessive requests
- Add better error recovery mechanisms for API failures
- Implement detailed user feedback for error conditions
- Review global state management approach for further optimization
